# Depth of Interfaces

## Summary
I understand my project more as an art piece. From a utility perspective, developer consoles built into all browsers are much better for looking at the exact properties of html elements. My goal is to remind people the genius of depth illusion and the concept of layers.

To achieve that, I'm using the analogy of art piece again. There will be two part of the project: the actual piece of art aiming to provide audience a first hand experience of layers (explosion diagrams of websites), and a "label" that inform the audience my concept of thoughts upon layers, and the piece itself.
## Contribution
For us who take layer as a concept for granted, realizing the brilliance of it may inspire new applications. I believe it's also a concept worth people out side of the design/developing community to know. It's a fun way to tell people details and history is essential.
## Prior Work
- [Crafting link underlines on Medium](https://medium.design/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9) : A project that changed how underlines are rendered on screen. Project leaded and article written by Marcin Wichary. An perfect example of how much thoughts and stories are behind one single detail in UI.
- [Material Design Guideline](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html) : Developed by Google, first published in 2014. A very good and clear usage of layers/depth/elevation in UI design.
- [Fauve Matisse](https://web.archive.org/web/20170201140928/http://pages.swcp.com/rtoads/vivisect/software/matisse.html) : Possibly the first time layer is introduced in a commercial software, before Adobe Photoshop 3.0, in 1994. This could be a good starting point for the history of layers, and it's important since computer/software development is often path dependent.
## Components
As mentioned before, there will be two main components of the project:
- A way to generate explosion diagrams of websites.
- A rather static site that explains the project.

## Challenges
To generate explosion diagrams from an url is my ultimate goal for the first part of the project. I'm expecting this being quite complicated as for involving making modifications to how websites are rendered in browsers. To figure out whether it's possible, then build it or fake is a challenge I'm expecting. I think it's possible but whether it's doable in the time frame of this class is what we'll see.
