# Three Refined Ideas
## 1. Brushes
**Create an environment for artists to exploit the potential of integrating computational practice into drawing and painting.**
### Related Work
- [Dynamic Brushes](https://jenniferjacobs.mat.ucsb.edu/index.html#db) : A research project done by Jennifer Jacobs, published in 2018. It explores the possibilities of integrating a graphical programming interface into tools for artistic practice. The project includes some testing result from artists test using the system.
- [Heavy Paint](https://www.heavypaint.app/home) : "A simple yet secretly powerful painting APP" by [Heavy Poly](https://www.heavypoly.com/contact) published around 2019. The App created a set of "brush" presets that are not achievable with non-digital media. It also maintained a community of artists exploring the possibility of the app. 
- [Good Brush](http://www.goodbrush.com/) : [Craig Mullins'](https://www.wikiart.org/en/craig-mullins) personal website. It's not a specific project, but he proved the value of incorporate digital technology into painting by producing exceptionally inspiring artworks back in the 90s.
### Contribution
I'm thinking of creating a tool for artists to explore the world of computational practice + drawing/painting without a barrier like there is now. We already know the possibility computational practice brings, but to fully embrace the potential there is a steep learning curve. Creating a starting point and direction to go could be a meaningful project.
### Challenge
I don't think it's quite possible for me to create such a thing within the time we have. So I need to figure out a way to prove my concept and maybe inspire others so make it happen together.
## 2. Depth of Interfaces
**Advocate the brilliance of layers in digital design.**
### Related Work
- [Crafting link underlines on Medium](https://medium.design/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9) : A project that changed how underlines are rendered on screen. Project leaded and article written by Marcin Wichary. An perfect example of how much thoughts and stories are behind one single detail in UI.
- [Material Design Guideline](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html) : Developed by Google, first published in 2014. A very good and clear usage of layers/depth/elevation in UI design.
- [Fauve Matisse](https://web.archive.org/web/20170201140928/http://pages.swcp.com/rtoads/vivisect/software/matisse.html) : Possibly the first time layer is introduced in a commercial software, before Adobe Photoshop 3.0, in 1994. This could be a good starting point for the history of layers, and it's important since computer/software development is often path dependent.
### Contribution
For us who take layer as a concept for granted, realizing the brilliance of it may inspire new applications. I believe it's also a concept worth people out side of the design/developing community to know. It's a fun way to tell people details and history is essential.
### Challenge
I need to get very familiar with the mechanism of how web pages are rendered and probably tweak it somehow to show what if the layers are not flattened.
## 3. Cars
**Build a retro game based on what I love about race cars.**
### Related Work
- [Art of Rally](http://artofrally.com/) : An indie rally racing game developed by [one man](http://absolutedrift.com/press/) published in September 2020. It's highly rated on all publishing and media platforms.
- [Circuit Superstars](https://www.originalfiregames.com/circuit-superstars) : An indie circuit racing game developed by a small team, Original Fire Games. Still in development, expected to be released in Q1 2021.
- [FR Legends](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fr-legends/id1435740083) : An indie drifting/stunt driving game developed by Twin Turbo Tech Co. It captured pretty well the essence of drifting and it's rated very high on all app stores.
### Contribution
It's hard to say what contribution a game like this has beside people having fun enjoying it.

It's been done so many times. What's something novel but fun at the same time I can come up with?
